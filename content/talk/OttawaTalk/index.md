abstract: 
Background. Code-switching (e.g. Let’s put on your manteau. It’s cold dehors.) is
common in the speech of bilingual adults, including in parent-child interactions (Byers-Heinlein,
2013). This may present unique challenges for the child’s language development. Bilingual
children experience processing difficulties when they encounter code-switching (Byers-Heinlein,
Morin-Lessard, &amp; Lew-Williams, 2017; Potter, Fourakis, Morin-Lessard, Byers-Heinlein, &amp;
Lew-Williams, 2019), and high rates of code-switching may also slow their vocabulary
development (e.g. Byers-Heinlein 2013).
