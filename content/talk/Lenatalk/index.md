#summary: An example talk using Academic's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: Code-switching (e.g., Let’s put on your manteau. It’s cold dehors.) is common in the speech of bilingual adults, including in parent-child interactions. Bilingual children experience processing difficulties when they encounter within-sentence code-switches but not between-sentence code-switches. However, there is little data on whether parents code-switch more frequently between sentences or within sentences when speaking to their infant, and whether this aspect of parents’ speech adapts to their child’s developing linguistic abilities. In this study, families with a French-English bilingual infant contributed home recordings using the Language ENvironment Analysis device at 10 and 18 months old. We found that parents used between-sentence code-switches more frequently than within-sentence code-switches when speaking to their infant. In addition, parents used a greater proportion of between-sentence code-switches when speaking to their child at 18 months old than at 10 months old. Thus, infants’ actual experience with code-switching might be minimally disruptive to their language acquisition.
