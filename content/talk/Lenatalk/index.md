Background. Code-switching (e.g. Let’s put on your manteau. It’s cold dehors.) is
common in the speech of bilingual adults, including in parent-child interactions (Byers-Heinlein,
2013). This may present unique challenges for the child’s language development. Bilingual
children experience processing difficulties when they encounter code-switching (Byers-Heinlein,
Morin-Lessard, &amp; Lew-Williams, 2017; Potter, Fourakis, Morin-Lessard, Byers-Heinlein, &amp;
Lew-Williams, 2019), and high rates of code-switching may also slow their vocabulary
development (e.g. Byers-Heinlein 2013).

Code-switches that occur within a single sentence (e.g. Let’s read un livre.) have been
found to be especially disruptive to language processing, compared to code-switches across a
sentence boundary (e.g. Let’s read a book. Veux-tu lire ce livre?) (Byers-Heinlein et al., 2017).
However, there is little data on how often parents produce each type of code-switch when talking
directly to their infant. Previous methods used to study parental code-switching behaviours (e.g.
parental reports) may not be representative of parents’ behaviours in everyday life and they may
not be accurately measuring code-switching, limiting our understanding of this phenomenon.
To date, there are no studies that have examined parental code-switching in a naturalistic
setting, specifically at home. Prior studies have also only investigated parental code-switching at
a single point in time, and thus whether parental code-switching follows a developmental
trajectory has never been investigated before. The present study used an archival dataset of home
language recordings to describe parents’ naturally produced code-switching.

Methods. Participants were twenty-one families with a 10-month-old French-English
bilingual infant living in Montreal, Quebec. Families contributed three days of home recordings
using the Language ENvironment Analysis (LENA) devices. Fifteen of these families
contributed an additional day of recording when their child was 18-months-old. Each instance
where a parent was speaking to their infant and alternating between English and French, was
coded as either a between-sentence or within-sentence code-switch.

Results. We found that parents used between-sentence code-switches more frequently
than within-sentence code-switches when speaking to their infant. In addition, parents used a
greater proportion of between-sentence code-switches when speaking to their child at 18-
months-old than at 10-months-old. Our results suggest that parents use the least disruptive type of code-switch for their child’s comprehension. Moreover, as children grow parents’ code-
switching may be changing in step with their child’s development. Thus, at least in some
communities, infants’ actual experience with code switching might be minimally disruptive to
their language acquisition.
